# 1. What are the best practices and strategies for efficiently enabling users to upload large files, such as those exceeding 1GB?
Uploading large files presents several challenges, especially when dealing with files that are 1GB or more
# Solutions:
* Chunked Uploads and Resumable Uploads: Break large files into smaller chunks that can be uploaded separately and retried if needed.
  
* Direct-to-Cloud Uploads: Avoid overloading the server by allowing users to upload files directly to cloud storage services like AWS S3, where upload processes are optimized for large files.
